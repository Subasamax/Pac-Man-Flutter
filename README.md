# Pac-Man-Flutter
Pac-man implementation in Flutter

## Current State
The current state is working but bugs might be encountered.

## TO-DO
  - Setting menu needs to be implemented.
      - Sound slider
      - music slider 
  - Sounds need to be implemented
  - Music needs to be implemented

## BUGS
The movement needs work as the ghosts will hit the walls and bounce off. This is because the time between each tick will vary, therefore the ghost will miss the collision to turn. Need to implement a solution that will be independent of time.
