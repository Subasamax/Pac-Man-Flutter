# Pac-Man-Flutter
Pac man implementation in flutter

## Current State
The current state is working but bugs might be encountered.

## BUGS
Movement needs work as the ghosts will hit the walls and bounce off. This is beacuase the time between each tick will vary, therefore the ghost will miss the collision to turn. Need to implement a solution that will be independent of time.
